Would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead

We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
""F- the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga

My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was fuck it, 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, go to the telly, hoe!

Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (booyah)

I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us

Live the life we saw in Friends
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love

No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze

Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love, and we don't wanna be found

I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)

A side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll

Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)

Pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolas at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed

No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts

Saying something 'bout You coming back soon
And got me thinking 'bout how
If You walked in now
What the hell I'd do

I wish I was on a plane or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Really, I don't wanna be
Caught in room 316
With a hotel Bible as a coaster underneath my beer

Lo que no sirve, que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedó grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa que de mí te enamores, baby (sheesh)
Sin Visa ni pasaporte (no)
Mandé tu falso amor de vacaciones (shee, shee, shee, shee)

Pa la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste si no te acuer-

No me vuelvas a llamar, que hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (sheesh)

Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te quería, no sé quién es ella
Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella

[RZA] Wu-Tang Clan comin at ya, protect ya neck kid, so set it off
De Inspector Deck
[Meth] watch ya step kid (8X)

[Inspector Deck]
I smoke on the mic like smokin Joe Frazier
The hell raiser, raisin hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep tickin
While I get ya flippin off the shit I'm kickin
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
Ya battle, you're sayin Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

[Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it goin on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if ya wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit ya with sixteen shots and more I got
Goin to war with the meltin pot hot

[Method]
It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth

In a one-horse town at a stable for two
We had matching scars and matching tattoos
Both dying to fit in
Ain't that some shit

And that scholarship was a ship that sailed
When I chose you and daddy gave me hell
I made myself into someone else just to love you, damn I loved you
Took all my plans and I put 'em in a box
Phantom pains for the wings I lost
Had me circling rings in the catalogs

You won't reply and we'll go back to strangers

Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture

I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)

Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense

Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork

But losing ground in this Chevrolet
That 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away
I showed up and she's gone
Guess I got to Tucson too late

Oh, you're so condescending
Your call is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated

But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night

I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, dream crusher

We could burn the whole thing down

All the whispered words, did you mean 'em at all?
Was I just another number that you'd call
On a late night in an empty room?

Do you think of me underneath the moonlit sky?
Took six months to heal and I don't know why
You're coming back now when I was almost over you

What am I, what am I, what am I gonna say?
When I see you again, I don't wanna pretend
And look the other way, oh

What am I, what am I, what am I gonna do?
Don't know if you miss me
Do you even forgive me for walking out on you?

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
But there was one prize I'd cheat to win
